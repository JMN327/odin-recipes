<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sweeten up your morning with this nifty way to prepare grapefruit! 
    This is the only way my mother could convince me to eat my grapefruit, and I still eat it this way.</p>
<ul>
    <li>4 grapefruit</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven's broiler.</li>
    <li>Cut the grapefruits in half, and use a small serrated knife to cut out the sections in the halves. 
        Spoon the sections and juice into a bowl, then scrape out all of the remaining thick skins and pulp. 
        Spoon the sections from the bowl back into the halves. This is best done one half at a time.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over the top of each grapefruit half, adjusting as you see fit. 
        Dot with butter. Place the halves on a cookie sheet.</li>
    <li>Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, until the butter is melted and sugar is starting to turn brown.</li>
</ol>
