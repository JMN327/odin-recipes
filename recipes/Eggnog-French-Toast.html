<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This eggnog French toast recipe is one you'll want to use year-round, but since it uses eggnog, 
    it makes it an extra special holiday treat that my family requests weekly! Serve warm with powdered 
    sugar and syrup if you like. The French toast goes well with scrambled eggs, too.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eggnog: This recipe will work best with store-bought eggnog. You can also use homemade eggnog, if you like.</li>

</ul>
