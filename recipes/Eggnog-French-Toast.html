        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This eggnog French toast recipe is one you'll want to use year-round, but since it uses eggnog, 
            it makes it an extra special holiday treat that my family requests weekly! Serve warm with powdered 
            sugar and syrup if you like. The French toast goes well with scrambled eggs, too.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggnog: This recipe will work best with store-bought eggnog. You can also use homemade eggnog, if you like.</li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs add richness and flavor. Plus, they help bind the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Spices: This eggnog French toast is spiced with cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.</li>
            <li>Bread: Choose a sturdy loaf that can stand up to soaking, such as French bread.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the first four ingredients together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Dip each slice of bread in the eggnog mixture.</li>
            <li>Cook each piece of bread on a skillet until golden on both sides.</li>
        </ol>
